# Structs in C Programming

A struct in C is a composite data type that allows you to group multiple variables of different data types under a single name. It's used to represent a record or a complex data structure.

Key points about structs:

1. **User-defined type**: Structs allow programmers to create their own custom data types.

2. **Grouping related data**: They are useful for grouping related variables that logically belong together.

3. **Members**: The variables within a struct are called members or fields.

4. **Access**: Members are accessed using the dot (.) operator.

5. **Memory allocation**: The members of a struct are stored in contiguous memory locations.

6. **Flexibility**: Structs can contain any data type, including other structs.

In the given example:

```c
struct my_struct {
    int x;
    int y;
};
```

This explanation provides a concise overview of structs in C, highlighting their purpose and key characteristics.
